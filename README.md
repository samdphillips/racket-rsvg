RSVG: an FFI binding for loading SVG images
-------------------------------------------

[![Scribble](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docs-Scribble-blue.svg)](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/rsvg/index.html)

Install:

```
 raco pkg install rsvg
```

Use:

```racket
 (require rsvg)
```

This library provides functions for loading SVG images as Racket bitmap
objects through an FFI binding to
[libRSVG](https://live.gnome.org/LibRsvg). The resulting bitmap objects
can then be freely manipulated with the `racket/draw` or
`pict` libraries.

Bug reports and patches welcome.
